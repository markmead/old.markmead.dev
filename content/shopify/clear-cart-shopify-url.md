A quick and easy way you can get a user to clear their cart is to direct them to the url `/cart/clear`.

```html
<a href="/cart/clear">Empty Cart</a>
```

Once the user has clicked this the cart will be cleared and they will be redirect back to their cart, now emptied.

This action is quick, the user will not be left waiting for the webpage to load (unless their internet is really slow).
