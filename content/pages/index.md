title: Hello, I'm Mark Mead
---

I’ve been a developer for roughly 5 years and I am currently a Full Stack Developer at
[Wiro Agency](https://www.wiro.agency/), a Shopify Plus agency.

I have a selection of <nuxt-link to="/projects">featured projects</nuxt-link>
and <nuxt-link to="/blogs">development blogs</nuxt-link> where I talk about the current stack that I’m using.

I work on two open source Tailwind CSS projects [HyperUI](https://hyperui.dev/) a component library for Tailwind CSS
and [Hypercolor](https://hypercolor.dev) a gradient library for Tailwind CSS.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/itsmarkmead) where I post about development
and announce new projects and blogs.
