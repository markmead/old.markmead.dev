        Hello, I'm Mark Mead.
      </h1>

      <p>
        I’ve been a developer for <index-duration time="01-01-2016" /> seconds, which is roughly 5 years. Currently, I am the Senior Developer at <index-external-link url="https://www.wearefuze.co.uk/" text="FUZE" />, a creative marketing agency helping brands go further.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have a selection of <index-internal-link name="projects" text="featured projects" /> and <index-internal-link name="blogs" text="development blogs" /> where I talk about the current stack that I’m using.
      </p>

      <p>
        My current stack is Ruby on Rails, Shopify, Vue (Nuxt), Tailwind CSS, Stimulus JS, Alpine JS and on occasions RSpec. However, that’s just the tip of the iceberg, I’ve written about <index-internal-link name="stack" text="my full tech stack" /> on this website.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work on two open source projects <index-external-link url="https://www.hyperui.dev/" text="HyperUI" /> a component library for Tailwind CSS and <index-external-link url="https://hypercolor.dev/" text="Hypercolor" /> a gradient library for Tailwind CSS.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can follow me on <index-external-link url="https://twitter.com/itsmarkmead" text="Twitter" /> where I post about development and announce new features and blogs.
