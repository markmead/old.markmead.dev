  <page-content title="My Teck Stack">
    <p>
      First off, I love my tech stack. I'm comfortable knowing that whatever I'm
      asked to do, I can do it, or I'm in a community that can help me learn it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Primarily, I use Ruby on Rails as my monolith builder with sprinkles of
      Alpine, Stimulus and Tailwind CSS on the frontend. However, Ruby on Rails
      doesn't have the hype around it that it once had, so I've been making a
      gradual shift to Laravel.
    </p>

    <p>
      When it comes to personal projects I'll typically use Vue, often with some
      extra power coming from Nuxt or Gridsome. This website as an example
      recently was rewritten in Nuxt after being in Gridsome for over a year.
      Why leave Gridsome? It doesn't seem to be in active development as much as
      Nuxt.
    </p>

    <p>
      There's the rare occassion that I will use Angular and Typescript. I have
      a few open source NPM packages that I have written in Typescript for it's
      more declarative approach.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've mentioned Tailwind CSS a few times now and I even own two open source
      projects built with and for Tailwind CSS
      <index-external-link url="https://www.hyperui.dev/" text="HyperUI" />
      and
      <index-external-link url="https://hypercolor.dev/" text="Hypercolor" />. I
      love Tailwind CSS, it gives you superpower CSS abilities without having to
      write CSS. That being said, I have love for Bootstrap and Foundation as
      that's what I started with.
    </p>

    <p>
      For deployment I'm split between a few. For Ruby on Rails projects I
      mainly use Heroku, but there's a recent push to move to Hatchbox (which is
      a Digital Ocean wrapper) for it's lower price. As for Vue projects, I use
      Vercel for everything. In the past I've been between Netlify and Vercel,
      but Vercel is cheaper and their domain management is incredible.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's worth mentioning the three horsemen of modern development; Webpack,
      PostCSS and Babel. I love these three and I am fairly comfortable making
      changes to them as their documentation is excellent, especially Webpack.
      However, I am making a shift to Rollup. Why? Webpack can be a little too
      much.
    </p>

    <p>
      For eCommerce projects I reach for Shopify. It's the easiest solution for
      developers and clients. In the past I have used Solidus, an open source
      eCommerce project built in Ruby on Rails but I do not rate that very
      highly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next steps for me would be incorporating React and especially Next JS
      into my tech stack.
